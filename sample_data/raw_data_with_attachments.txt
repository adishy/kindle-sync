Introduction
Highlight(yellow) - Location 31
Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-= free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 171
The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming = increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valu= able in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, an= d then make it the core of their working life, will thrive. This book has t= wo goals, pursued in two parts. The first, tackled in Part 1, is to convinc= e you that the deep work hypothesis is true. The second, tackled in Part 2,= is to teach you how to take advantage of this reality by training your bra= in and transforming your work habits to place deep work at the core of your= professional life.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 201
More generally, the lack of distraction in my life tones down that back= ground hum of nervous mental energy that seems to increasingly pervade peop= le=E2=80=99s daily lives.
Chapter 1: Deep Work Is Valuable
Highlight(yellow) - Location 265
It no longer makes sense, for example, to hire a full-time programmer, = put aside office space, and pay benefits, when you can instead pay one of t= he world=E2=80=99s best programmers, like Hansson, for just enough time to = complete the project at hand.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 285
An increasing number of individuals in our economy are now competing wi= th the rock stars of their sectors.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 338
this process of mastering hard things never ends: You must be able to d= o it quickly, again and again.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 343
If you can=E2=80=99t learn, you can=E2=80=99t thrive.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 352
If you don=E2=80=99t produce, you won=E2=80=99t thrive=E2=80=94no matte= r how skilled or talented you are.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 355
The two core abilities just described depend on your ability to perform= deep work.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 384
Its core components are usually identified as follows: (1) your attenti= on is focused tightly on a specific skill you=E2=80=99re trying to improve = or an idea you=E2=80=99re trying to master; (2) you receive feedback so you= can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it=E2=80=99= s most productive.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 405
To learn hard things quickly, you must focus intensely without distract= ion.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 478
To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods wit= h full concentration on a single task free from distraction.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 508
A good chief executive is essentially a hard-to-automate decision engin= e, not unlike IBM=E2=80=99s Jeopardy!-playing Watson system.
Chapter 2: Deep Work Is Rare

Highlight(yellow) - Location 668
The Principle of Least Resistance, protected from scrutiny by the metri= c black hole, supports work cultures that save us from the short-term disco= mfort of concentration and planning, at the expense of long-term satisfacti= on and the production of real value.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 783
deep work is hard and shallow work is easier, that in the absence of cl= ear goals for your job, the visible busyness that surrounds shallow work be= comes self-preserving, and that our culture has developed a belief that if = a behavior relates to =E2=80=9Cthe Internet,=E2=80=9D then it=E2=80=99s goo= d=E2=80=94regardless of its impact on our ability to produce valuable thing= s.
Chapter 3: Deep Work Is Meaningful
Highlight(yellow) - Location 873
Gallagher=E2=80=99s grand theory to better understand
Highlight(yellow) - Location 930
=E2=80=9CThe best moments usually occur when a person=E2=80=99s body or= mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish someth= ing difficult and worthwhile.=E2=80=9D
Highlight(yellow) - Location 938
When measured empirically, people were happier at work and less happy r= elaxing than they suspected. And as the ESM studies confirmed, the more suc= h flow experiences that occur in a given week, the higher the subject=E2=80= =99s life satisfaction. Human beings, it seems, are at their best when imme= rsed deeply in something challenging.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 947
Deep work is an activity well suited to generate a flow state
Highlight(yellow) - Location 955
To build your working life around the experience of flow produced by de= ep work is a proven path to deep satisfaction.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 10= 32
This is perhaps the best way to sum up the argument of this chapter and= of Part 1 more broadly: A deep life is a good life, any way you look at it.
Rule #1: Work Deeply
Highlight(yellow) - Location 10= 95
You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use = it.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 10= 98
The same will happen to you, regardless of your intentions=E2=80=94unle= ss, that is, you=E2=80=99re smart about your habits.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 11= 23
You need your own philosophy for integrating deep work into your profes= sional life.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 11= 25
You must be careful to choose a philosophy that fits your specific circ= umstances, as a mismatch here can derail your deep work habit before it has= a chance to solidify.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 11= 29
The Monastic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling
Highlight(yellow) - Location 11= 41
monastic philosophy of deep work scheduling. This philosophy attempts t= o maximize deep efforts by eliminating or radically minimizing shallow obli= gations.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 11= 42
Practitioners of the monastic philosophy tend to have a well-defined an= d highly valued professional goal that they=E2=80=99re pursuing, and the bu= lk of their professional success comes from doing this one thing exceptiona= lly well.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 11= 58
If I organize my life in such a way that I get lots of long, consecutiv= e, uninterrupted time-chunks, I can write novels. But as those chunks get s= eparated and fragmented, my productivity as a novelist drops spectacularly.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 11= 79
Jung did not deploy a monastic approach to deep work.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 11= 81
Jung, by contrast, sought this elimination only during the periods he s= pent at his retreat.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 11= 87
bimodal philosophy of deep work. This philosophy asks that you divide y= our time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and le= aving the rest open to everything else.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 11= 93
The bimodal philosophy believes that deep work can produce extreme prod= uctivity, but only if the subject dedicates enough time to such endeavors t= o reach maximum cognitive intensity=E2=80=94the state in which real breakth= roughs occur. This is why the minimum unit of time for deep work in this ph= ilosophy tends to be at least one full day.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 12= 13
people will usually respect your right to become inaccessible if these = periods are well defined and well advertised, and outside these stretches, = you=E2=80=99re once again easy to find.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 12= 26
rhythmic philosophy. This philosophy argues that the easiest way to con= sistently start deep work sessions is to transform them into a simple regul= ar habit.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 12= 28
The chain method is a good example of the rhythmic philosophy of deep w= ork scheduling because it combines a simple scheduling heuristic (do the wo= rk every day), with an easy way to remind yourself to do the work: the big = red Xs on the calendar.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 12= 51
nature. By supporting deep work with rock-solid routines that make sure= a little bit gets done on a regular basis, the rhythmic scheduler will oft= en log a larger total number of deep hours per year.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 13= 17
In fact, perhaps the single best piece of advice I can offer to anyone = trying to do creative work is to ignore inspiration.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 13= 21
To make the most out of your deep work sessions, build rituals of the s= ame level of strictness and idiosyncrasy as the important thinkers mentione= d previously.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 13= 24
Their rituals minimized the friction in this transition to depth, allow= ing them to go deep more easily and stay in the state longer.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 13= 26
There=E2=80=99s no one correct deep work ritual=E2=80=94the right fit d= epends on both the person and the type of project pursued.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 13= 28
Your ritual needs to specify a location for your deep work efforts.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 13= 32
Regardless of where you work, be sure to also give yourself a specific = time frame to keep the session a discrete challenge and not an open-ended s= log.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 13= 96
In all of these examples, it=E2=80=99s not just the change of environme= nt or seeking of quiet that enables more depth. The dominant force is the p= sychology of committing so seriously to the task at hand. To put yourself i= n an exotic location to focus on a writing project, or to take a week off f= rom work just to think, or to lock yourself in a hotel room until you compl= ete an important invention: These gestures push your deep goal to a level o= f mental priority that helps unlock the needed mental resources. Sometimes = to go deep, you must first go big. Don=E2=80=99t Work Alone The relationshi= p between deep work and collaboration is tricky. It=E2=80=99s worth taking = the time to untangle, however, because properly leveraging collaboration ca= n increase the quality of deep work in your professional life.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 14= 94
Separate your pursuit of serendipitous encounters from your efforts to = think deeply and build on these inspirations.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 14= 95
You should try to optimize each effort separately, as opposed to mixing= them together into a sludge that impedes both goals.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 14= 97
By working side by side with someone on a problem, you can push each ot= her toward deeper levels of depth, and therefore toward the generation of m= ore and more valuable output as compared to working alone.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 15= 24
Discipline #1: Focus on the Wildly Important
Highlight(yellow) - Location 15= 26
They elaborate that execution should be aimed at a small number of =E2= =80=9Cwildly important goals.=E2=80=9D This simplicity will help focus an o= rganization=E2=80=99s energy to a sufficient intensity to ignite real resul= ts.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 15= 27
For an individual focused on deep work, the implication is that you sho= uld identify a small number of ambitious outcomes to pursue with your deep = work hours.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 15= 38
In 4DX, there are two types of metrics for this purpose: lag measures a= nd lead measures.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 15= 38
Lag measures describe the thing you=E2=80=99re ultimately trying to imp= rove.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 15= 41
Lead measures, on the other hand, =E2=80=9Cmeasure the new behaviors th= at will drive success on the lag measures.=E2=80=9D
Highlight(yellow) - Location 15= 43
As you increase this number, your lag measures will likely eventually i= mprove as well.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 15= 50
Discipline #3: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard
Highlight(yellow) - Location 15= 53
it=E2=80=99s important that they have a public place to record and trac= k their lead measures.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 15= 57
the individual=E2=80=99s scoreboard should be a physical artifact in th= e workspace that displays the individual=E2=80=99s current deep work hour c= ount.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 15= 66
Discipline #4: Create a Cadence of Accountability
Highlight(yellow) - Location 15= 72
For an individual focused on his or her own deep work habit, there=E2= =80=99s likely no team to meet with, but this doesn=E2=80=99t exempt you fr= om the need for regular accountability.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 15= 74
the workweek ahead (see Rule #4). During my experiments with 4DX, I use= d a weekly review to look over my scoreboard to celebrate good weeks, help = understand what led to bad weeks, and most important, figure out how to ens= ure a good score for the days ahead.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 16= 09
At the end of the workday, shut down your consideration of work issues = until the next morning=E2=80=94no after-dinner e-mail check, no mental repl= ays of conversations, and no scheming about how you=E2=80=99ll handle an up= coming challenge; shut down work thinking completely. If you need more time= , then extend your workday, but once you shut down, your mind must be left = free to encounter Kreider=E2=80=99s buttercups, stink bugs, and stars.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 16= 15
Reason #1: Downtime Aids Insights
Highlight(yellow) - Location 16= 26
Observations from experiments such as this one led Dijksterhuis and his= collaborators to introduce unconscious thought theory (UTT)=E2=80=94an att= empt to understand the different roles conscious and unconscious deliberati= on play in decision making. At a high level, this theory proposes that for = decisions that require the application of strict rules, the conscious mind = must be involved.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 16= 30
On the other hand, for decisions that involve large amounts of informat= ion and multiple vague, and perhaps even conflicting, constraints, your unc= onscious mind is well suited to tackle the issue.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 16= 31
UTT hypothesizes that this is due to the fact that these regions of you= r brain have more neuronal bandwidth available, allowing them to move aroun= d more information and sift through more potential solutions than your cons= cious centers of thinking.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 16= 36
The implication of this line of research is that providing your conscio= us brain time to rest enables your unconscious mind to take a shift sorting= through your most complex professional challenges.
Highlight(yellow) - Location 16= 38
Reason #2: Downtime Helps Recharge the Energy Needed to Work Deeply
Highlight(yellow) - Location 16= 73
Reason #3: The Work That Evening Downtime Replaces Is Usually Not That = Important
