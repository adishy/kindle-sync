    Your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits. It’s a two-way street. The formation of all habits is a feedback loop (a concept we will explore in depth in the next chapter), but it’s important to let your values, principles, and identity drive the loop rather than your results. The focus should always be on becoming that type of person, not getting a particular outcome.

<div class="noteText">
    The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.*
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps > Page 47 · Location 655
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    First, there is the cue. The cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior. It is a bit of information that predicts a reward.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps > Page 48 · Location 662
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Cravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force behind every habit. Without some level of motivation or desire—without craving a change—we have no reason to act.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps > Page 48 · Location 669
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    The third step is the response. The response is the actual habit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps > Page 49 · Location 674
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Finally, the response delivers a reward. Rewards are the end goal of every habit. The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps > Page 49 · Location 683
</div>
<div class="noteText">
    Reduce the craving and you won’t experience enough motivation to act. Make the behavior difficult and you won’t be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you’ll have no reason to do it again in the future.
</div><div class="noteHeading">
    Highlight(<span class="highlight_orange">orange</span>) - 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps > Page 50 · Location 692

<div class="noteText">
    In summary, the cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue.

    In the early 1990s, the cleaning staff at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam installed a small sticker that looked like a fly near the center of each urinal. Apparently, when men stepped up to the urinals, they aimed for what they thought was a bug. The stickers improved their aim and significantly reduced “spillage” around the urinals. Further analysis determined that the stickers cut bathroom cleaning costs by 8 percent per year.
